# ChatGPT Clone

This project is a simple PHP application that interacts with the OpenAI API using the "o1-mini" model to create a chat interface similar to ChatGPT.

## Project Structure

- **src/chat.php**: Contains the main logic for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- **src/helpers/apiHelper.php**: Includes helper functions for making API requests and handling responses.
- **public/index.php**: The entry point for the web application, rendering the chat interface and handling user input.
- **.env**: Stores environment variables, such as the API key, to keep sensitive information secure.
- **composer.json**: Configuration file for Composer, listing project dependencies and autoloading information.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatgpt-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Composer installed, then run:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   You can use a local server to run the application. For example, using PHP's built-in server:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to start chatting!

## Usage

Type your messages in the chat interface, and the application will send them to the OpenAI API, returning responses generated by the "o1-mini" model.
